# Why live in Megacities?
I think that most people want services nearby, want the places where they work close the their homes, see other people nearby, as well as leisure centers and places where you can do various activities, while not spending much time and resources to transport yourself. We want public transportation, walkability, attractions, restaurants, malls, medical care, parks...

As a business you don't want to transport your products long distances. As an individual, in order to be able to trade products you would like to have as many people as possible near you. It's more efficient to share the resources instead of building everything from scratch now and again. It's more efficient to have a road, a train, or a scooter sharing company if a lot of people will use it.

We are [7.7 billion people](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/), and the earth shouldn't be just for housing one mediocre city after another one. I think we should plan a big gorgeous city, choose a good place, and build it, rather than expanding chaotically our current cities.
